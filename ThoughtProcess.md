# fibonacci-cells

Prompt:
"Create a grid of 50x50. When you click on a cell, all values in the
cells in the same row and column are increased by 1. If a cell is
empty, it will get a value of 1. After each change a cell will briefly
turn yellow. If 5 consecutive numbers in the Fibonacci sequence
are next to each other, these cells will briefly turn green and will
be cleared. Use the programming language of your choice."

Goals:

- Create a grid of 50x50 cells. - Done
- When a cell is clicked, all cells in the same row and column are increased by 1. - Done
- If a cell is empty, it will get a value of 1. - Done
- After each change, the affected cells will briefly turn yellow. - Done
- If 5 consecutive numbers in the Fibonacci sequence are next to each other, these cells will briefly turn green and will be cleared.

Fibonacci Sequence: 1, 1, 2, 3, 5, 8, 13, 21, 34, 55, 89, 144, 233, 377, 610, 987, 1597, 2584, 4181, 6765, 10946, 17711, 28657, 46368, 75025, 121393, 196418, 317811, 514229

this is an example of a legal fib sequence: 1, 1, 2, 3, 5
algorithm is needed to check for 5 consecutive numbers in the Fibonacci sequence next to each other [does this include diagonals?]
